If you were to catch the beast that dwells in the depths...&#x000A;But as you finally reel the fish in, with thunderous clouds chasing in on you, all that comes from it is a single, cute goldfish with a red spot on its forehead.

There's solid ground underneath your feet, and a large ceiling above your head. You can't make out the material it's made out of. There's large streetlamps to illuminate the path and a large fountain of clear water in the middle. Children are dnacing in a circle in the bag, a cat is meowing from a roof. People walk around, chat, look at you as you stand at the entrance. An imposing clock tower can be seen from the distance, almost reaching the yellow round drawing of a moon. The smell of wood and bakeries is overwhelming.&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see Old lady, Gentleman, Lotty, Nutcracker, Fisherman, Polly and a purse here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

As you enter the building, you're met with an owl guard whose head turns into your diretion as your first footsteps echo through the marble-covered floor. To the north, you see a staircase that leads up the slim tower, seemingly leading into a circle as you climb the building.
